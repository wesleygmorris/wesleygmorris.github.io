career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I spent fifteen years as a classroom teacher before returning
      to complete my PhD at Peabody College at Vanderbilt University.
      I use NLP tools such as transformer models in educational tools
      and assessment, including predicting human ratings of text quality,
      question and answer generation, and sequence classification. I am
      also familiar with statistical techniques such as multi-level modeling,
      structural equation modeling, and item response theory to examine 
      rater effects in research and educational measurement. My research 
      interest is in using deep learning techniques to analyze speech acoustics,
      specifically in terms of prosody, phonology, and pragmatics of natural
      speech.
